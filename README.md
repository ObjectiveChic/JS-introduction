Modifying the Instagram API 
https://github.com/robynitp/networkedmedia/wiki/Instagram-API-How-to 

Class Assignment: 

Create a single web page that, upon user input, responds with data from the Instagram web API. One approach to this assignment could be to design the page around answering a question for the user. An example of this is www.doineedanumbrella.com

Remember:
(1) a user needs to "trigger" an event
(2) data needs to be requested via AJAX from the APIs, and 
(3) the page should update appropriately. 

 Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

#Week 10, Class 1 & 2: More About APIs 

Create a single web page that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web APIs. 
APIs are to be decided, students are to work in pairs on this assignment.

Remember:

(1) a user needs to "trigger" an event
(2) data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and 
(3) the page should update appropriately. 

Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.
